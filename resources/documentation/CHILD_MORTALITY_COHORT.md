# KansenKaart preprocessing components â€“ Child mortality cohort
To create the child mortality cohort, we use the KansenKaart preprocessing pipeline that has four components. Here, we describe these four components in greater detail. The child mortality cohort uses a different pipeline since this cohort is defined differently than the other cohorts. 


## 1. Cohort creation



## 2. Predictor creation




## 3. Outcome creation



## 4. Post-processing
In the post-processing component, we select variables from the created cohort data sets that are relevant for our estimates.
