1. c00_sga (small-for-gestational age): a birth weight below the 10th percentile adjusted for gestational age and gender, according to the [Hoftiezer curve]( https://github.com/sodascience/kansenkaart_preprocessing/blob/cbs_updated/resources/Hoftiezer_Geboortegewicht%20curves.xlsx). 
2. c00_preterm_birth: a gestational age before 37 completed weeks of gestation. 

## 7. Child mortality cohort
The child mortality cohort consists of approximately 1.5 million Dutch children who were born between 2008 and 2016. We assign these children to their home address where they live at birth.

1. c00_perinatal_mortality: death that occurs between 24 completed weeks of gestation and up to 7 days after birth.
2. c00_neonatal_mortality: death that occurs between 24 completed weeks of gestation and up to 28 days after birth.
3. c00_infant_mortality: death that occurs between 24 completed weeks of gestation and up to 365 days after birth.

Note that the child mortality cohort uses different components than the other cohorts since the base data set of the child mortality cohort consists of individuals from the PRNL microdata instead of the GBAPERSOONTAB microdata.
